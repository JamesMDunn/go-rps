# Rock Paper Scissors with distinctive features of golang, go channels and goroutines

Created a program simulating 2 players (each running on a goroutine)
playing Rock Paper Scissors for 100 rounds, in each round they have to send their option to the
referee ( via a go channel), which will determine the winner/loser/draw
